# My first coding experience

My first coding experience in 2009, when my dad "started stressing" me with a new developing language called Python. I'm still grateful to him as right now, despite I don't yet know how to program (you don't say) I have slowly learnt how to start coding a software and how to use versioning control softwares like git.

Initially I wasn't enough sure to start learning this new programming language since, as everyone may imagine, "where should I start? What should I code? Is my new fantastic project worth it or it's just a reinvention of the wheel?". 
Anyways, I don't gave a $hit about that stuff, since I learnt a lot, despite I was just learning stuff as a self-taught.
For those who aren't yet in the programming world (neither do I but I really would love joining it) or are just curious as me 10 years ago: guyz, start with a programming language and expand your horizons. You can't even imagine how many things you can do with a single programming language. There are tons of free online resources which can help you learning stuff. Start imagining like if you are working in a company: how will you start coding? Where's the start point?

# Coding editors

Well, this is a hot-point as I learnt and switched from many code editors.
My first code editor was **drumroll**: `nano`.
Yeah you're probably asking yourself: are you idiot or what? 
Well there's a start point for everyone, and you shouldn't give a f*** about your first editor.

Below a stupid list of my coding editor experience:

- `nano` since 2009 never abandoned me. I still use it nowadays if I'm too lazy to use vim
- `Python2.7 IDE`, which came preinstalled with Python2.7, when I firstly installed it in 2009
- `Sublime Text`, discovered just in 2012, and wasn't bad at all. The bad point, sadly, is that it requires a paid-license, and doesn't have many plugins/themes compared to Visual Studio Code or many others
- `Atom`, it lasted just foor 2 days then uninstalled. Reason? It lagged a lot and idk y
- `Brackets`, same as Atom but this time I used it just for `Live Web-Server` stuff. Abandoned after 3 months
- `Visual Studio Code` used since 2017 and probably is the best code editor ever found. Despite it's made by Microsoft, but it has so many plugins and themes and doesn't weigh much
- `vi/vim/neovim`, used since late-2019/first-2020 and holy f***, when you first start using it, your fingers will literally explode

Btw, you probably came here without knowing why, neither do I. Why am I writing this whole stuff? help

Below a stupid list of my Visual Studio Code extensions which I found useful in those years (thx @exusr for helping me cleaning out $hit)

### `Extensions & Themes`

- `ahoseinian.region-folder` - Useful for folding regions
- `arcticicestudio.nord-visual-studio-code` -  theme I'm using rn
- `codezombiech.gitignore` - language support for .gitignore files
- `dbaeumer.vscode-eslint` - Integrates ESLint JavaScript into VS Code.
- `eamodio.gitlens` - Best GIT extensions. Contains lot of stuff
- `formulahendry.code-runner` - runs code snippet or code file for multiple languages
- `gruntfuggly.todo-tree` - Show TODO, FIXME, etc. comment tags in a tree view
- `hookyqr.beautify` - Beautify code in place for VS Code
- `james-yu.latex-workshop` - Boost LaTeX typesetting efficiency with preview, compile, autocomplete, colorize, and more.
- `ms-python.python` - Python stuff
- `ms-vscode.cpptools` - C++ stuff (using it with PlatformIO)
- `octref.vetur` - Vue stuff
- `platformio.platformio-ide` - A replacement for Arduino IDE
- `shd101wyy.markdown-preview-enhanced` - A really useful extensions for those who write in markdown pretty 24/7 and want a live preview on the side
- `shyykoserhiy.vscode-spotify` - Just start VSCode in full-screen mode and enjoy your playlists
- `tyriar.theme-sapphire` - Another theme

Anyways, I don't even know if I'll maintain more this list, but was just too lazy to lay on the bed that decided to write this thing.
I hope you enjoyed my neapolitan-english statements HAHA, I'm learning english slowly but improving it with TV series (last TV series I watched was Mr. Robot, 12/10 recommended)
